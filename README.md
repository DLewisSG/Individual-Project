### Definition of done


The project will be done when the following is met:

* Coding is complete this includes:

>*	All CRUD operations are functional
>*	GUI interfaces are aesthetically pleasing and easy to use
>*	New users can register
>*	There are no compiler errors
>*	The code has been refactored

* User documentation such as guides are ready.

* Unit Testing has been completed.

* No defects.

### Sprint review

* Created the Model and built a database using Entity framework.

* Added data to all tables.

* Created a GUI to allow the users to interact with the project.

* Created the CRUD functionality for the Articles page.

* Created some unit tests for the functions.

### Sprint retrospective

I think this sprint went well as I built the core functions of the project.
 I would break tasks down into smaller tasks going forward as overcomplicating each sprint cost me considerable amounts
of time.

### Project review

Overall, I have learned a lot from this project. I overcame some
obstacles particularly when I had issues displaying integers in text boxes.
 I learned that breaking a project down into smaller tasks before implementing 
can keep me in control of the project as I had to restart due to messy code and no clear direction.
I think the final project could have been improved by adding in more interfaces and allowing users to interact
with some of the other tables in the database.
